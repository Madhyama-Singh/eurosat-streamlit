# eurosat-streamlit

The EuroSAT Classifier is a Streamlit web app that predicts land use and land cover types from satellite imagery using the EuroSAT dataset. The dataset contains 64×64 pixel RGB images across 10 classes (Annual Crop, Forest, Herbaceous Vegetation, Highway, Industrial, Pasture, Permanent Crop, Residential, River, Sea/Lake). Users can upload an image, and the app—powered by a trained Fully Connected Neural Network (FNN)—will output the predicted class and confidence score.
